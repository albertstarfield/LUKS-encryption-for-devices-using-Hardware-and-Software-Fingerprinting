# LUKS-encryption-for-devices-using-Hardware-and-Software-Fingerprinting
This project aims to provide an additional layer of security for devices through the implementation of LUKS encryption, while also utilizing hardware and software fingerprinting to ensure only authorized individuals can access the encrypted data.
## Features
- Implementation of LUKS encryption for device data security
- Utilization of hardware and software fingerprinting for additional authentication
- Abstraction layer for the convenience of generating keyfile
- Auto-unlockupon bootup
- User-friendly interface for easy data decryption, encryption, and unlocking
## How to Get Started
1. Git clone the repository
2. chmod +x install.sh
3. Execute install.sh
4. To add your preexisting ext4 volume, execute bash createLUKSVolume and follow the instruction to convert to the LUKS+dmcrypt volume or you can configure it yourself manually
